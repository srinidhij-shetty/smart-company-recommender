# smart-company-recommender
 AI-powered company  matching system that recommends the most relevant company based on the user’s intent.
 
## 🚀 What It Does

Instead of scraping and dumping raw leads, this app asks:

> 📝 "What do you need a company for?"

Using a transformer-based AI model, it finds the **top 3 companies** that best match the user's request, and explains **why they matched** (via keyword or semantic overlap).
